# ~/.dotfiles

System configuration files I've honed to get my machines to my liking. Much of the work is heavily borrowed from others
that I've come across on GitHub and elsewhere (many thanks goes out to them). These files are primarily focused towards
configuring macOS, however, recently I've made a major effort to automate Linux setup as well.

## Install

```sh
git clone https://github.com/cjhutchi/dotfiles ~/.dotfiles
cd ~/.dotfiles
script/bootstrap
```

## Changelog

* January 24, 2021 - First major update in a long while. Re-worked the bootstrap script to handle many Linux cases. Removed a bunch of more or less useless scripts from the bin as well.
